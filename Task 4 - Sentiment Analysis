Task 4 - Sentiment Analysis

Objective:
To analyze user reviews and classify them into Positive, Negative, or Neutral using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.


Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn (Naive Bayes)
- NLP (Stopwords, Stemming)
- CountVectorizer
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

Project Steps:
1. Load and clean text data
2. Preprocess using NLP (lowercase, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming)
3. Convert text to numbers using CountVectorizer
4. Train a Naive Bayes classifier
5. Evaluate performance (accuracy, classification report)
6. Visualize sentiment distribution

Output:
- Accuracy: ~85%+
- Graph showing number of Positive/Negative/Neutral reviews

Key Learning:
- Text cleaning & feature extraction
- Supervised classification
- Sentiment insights from real-world reviews
