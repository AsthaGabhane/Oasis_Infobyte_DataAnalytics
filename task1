📊 Oasis Infobyte – Data Analytics Internship (June 2025)

Welcome to my project repository for the virtual Data Analytics Internship at Oasis Infobyte.  
Here, I’ll be uploading all the tasks I complete during this internship, including source code, visuals, and final reports.
📁 Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Warehouse & Retail Sales
📌 Objective:
To analyze the sales performance of various suppliers and item types across retail and warehouse channels using a real-world dataset.
📂 Dataset Used:
Name: Warehouse_and_Retail_Sales.csv  
Columns Included:
- YEAR  
- MONTH  
- SUPPLIER  
- ITEM CODE  
- ITEM DESCRIPTION  
- ITEM TYPE  
- RETAIL SALES  
- RETAIL TRANSFERS  
- WAREHOUSE SALES 
 🔍 Process Followed:

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Removed missing values (if any)
   - Checked and dropped duplicate rows

2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
   - Analyzed total retail and warehouse sales
   - Grouped data by supplier and item type
   - Identified top contributors to sales

3. Visualization:
   - Created bar plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib
   - Top 10 Suppliers by Warehouse Sales
   - Item Type–wise Retail Sales

4. Insights Generation:
   - Observed sales trends and supplier dominance
   - Used 80/20 logic to derive business conclusions

📌 Key Insights:

- Crown Imports is the leading supplier with over **1.6 million units** in warehouse sales.
- Top 3 suppliers (Crown Imports, Miller Brewing Company, Anheuser Busch Inc) dominate the distribution chain.
- There is a sharp drop in sales volume after the top 4 suppliers, indicating a **skewed distribution**.
- The pattern resembles the **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)** — a small group of suppliers contributes to the majority of sales.
